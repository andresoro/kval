# kval
A simple memory key-value store with time duration. Kval is essentially an in-memory dictionary with concurrent read/write access.
This project serves as a way to learn key-value databases by building a simple one. 

Todo:
* Add item expiration (Use FIFO queue)
    * Add proper testing
* Add TCP server endpoints
* Add file persistence for easy restarting
