# kval
A simple memory key-value store with time duration. Kval is essentially an in-memory dictionary with concurrent read/write access.
This project serves as a way to learn key-value databases by building a simple one. 

Todo:

* Documentation
* Add a max item size and/or max cache size
* Add file persistence for easy restarting
